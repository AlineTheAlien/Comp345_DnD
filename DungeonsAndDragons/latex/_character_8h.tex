\subsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \hyperlink{class_character}{Character} class. 

Game rules explained\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To calculate character\textquotesingle{}s ability scores, 4 six-\/sided dice are rolled, where the highest 3 are kept and summed.
\item This is repeated 5 more times to have a total of 6 scores. They are distributed in the character\textquotesingle{}s ability scores based on the priorities for fighter class.
\item The priority is\+: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom.
\item Then, to calculate the ability modifiers, we add 10 to the ability scores, divide by 2, and round down.
\item Initial hit points are found by having 10 summed with the character\textquotesingle{}s calculated constitution modifier.
\item At later levels, hit points are found by adding a d10 dice roll and the character\textquotesingle{}s constitution modifier to the previous hp.
\item \hyperlink{class_armor}{Armor} class depends on the type of armor worn, but for the constructor it is 11 + dexterity modifier.
\item Attack bonus depends on level, but for the constructor, attack bonus is just strength + dexterity modifiers.
\item Damage bonus is also dependant on level, but initially is is simply the strength modifier.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Design of assignment\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The design of this program is that it is constituted of a \hyperlink{class_character}{Character} header file.
\item It also has the \hyperlink{class_character}{Character} cpp file which is the class definition of the \hyperlink{class_character}{Character} class.
\item \hyperlink{class_character}{Character} objects will be initialized by default to be of the fighter class, for the sake of the project.
\item There are also 2 test files, the Character\+Test header, and the corresponding Character\+Test cpp file.
\item They are the unit tests which validate major test cases of the functionalities of the program using C\+P\+P\+Unit framework.
\item Finally, there is the main function which runs either the test cases, or the driver to demonstrate the program.
\item (By default I have commented out the unit tests \hyperlink{_driver_8cpp_a0ddf1224851353fc92bfbff6f499fa97}{main()} function, simply uncomment them and comment the driver to view the unit tests).
\item \hyperlink{class_character}{Character} and \hyperlink{class_subject}{Subject} classes have been added for assignment 2, which are the abstract classes that make up the observer design pattern.
\item As \hyperlink{class_character}{Character} is the subject for this assignment, it inherits from the \hyperlink{class_subject}{Subject} class, while \hyperlink{class_character_observer}{Character\+Observer}, the observer class created, inherits from \hyperlink{class_observer}{Observer} class.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Libraries used\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I have used many libraries to boost the performance and functionality of the program.
\item The iostream library is used to allow output to the console for viewing purposes.
\item The ctime and windows.\+h libraries were used to access the machine real time for the randomizer functions optimization.
\item math.\+h was used for the simple mathematics functions to avoid unecessary coding, such as the floor() function to round down a double.
\item string was included because objects of type string were used in the program to display the equipped items of the character.
\item And finally, for the driver, some C\+P\+P\+Unit libraries were included to perform and run the test cases
