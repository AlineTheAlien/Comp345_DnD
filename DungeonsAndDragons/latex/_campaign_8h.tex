Header file for the \hyperlink{class_campaign}{Campaign} The following class implements the campaign class according to the requirements. A vector of strings was used to identify the maps linked in the campaign The vector allows to load maps in order according to their specified path Vectors are dynamic and allow to add elements to it without knowning its size previously The library used to serialization of class is Boost.\+Serialization It was used because of its efficiency and portability. With Boost, it is possible to serialize and export a class into a binary data file.
