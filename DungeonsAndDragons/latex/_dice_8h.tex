\subsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \hyperlink{class_dice}{Dice} class. 

1) The rules of using the \hyperlink{class_dice}{Dice} in the game are\+: The player first needs to choose the type of dice, the number of times he wants to roll it and his boost. 2) In my design, the player can enter a string with spaces and it will still be accepted. First off, the player enter the dice string in the form of \char`\"{}xdy+z\char`\"{} following the game rules defined. Next the program has a function is\+Valid that takes the entered string and matches a regex pattern that follows the desired string format. This is done after parsing the stringt o remove any whitespace. The roll function, which accepts the string \char`\"{}xdy+z\char`\"{} uses the is\+Valid function firstly to validate the string, if invalid -\/1 is returned. If the string is valid, then the digits x, y, z are stored in a vector at there distinctive position following their order in th string. The roll method then generates a random number for each dice roll (value x) and sums them all together and returns the total value summedd with the oprional z. 3) No libraries were used.
