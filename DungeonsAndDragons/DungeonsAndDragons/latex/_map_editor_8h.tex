Header file for the \hyperlink{class_map_editor}{Map\+Editor} class The following class implements the map editor according to the requirements. It allows a user to modify, and create maps The user can load previously created maps and save new ones The library used for serialization of classes is Boost.\+Serialization It was used because of its efficiency and portability. With Boost, it is possible to serialize and export a class into a binary data file Vectors were used to display the available maps. They are dynamic and useful when the size of the map list isn\textquotesingle{}t known in advance.
