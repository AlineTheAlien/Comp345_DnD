Get all attributes of the enemy

Every time a character levels up, we assume the character gets two ability scores to be added any of to the current ability scores

Since the character is a fighter, a d10 hit dice was used to get a number that will be added or removed to the total and current hit points

After getting the ability scores bonus that must be assigned, randomly assign to one of the abilities. If the player level is higher than the current enemy level, it will increase some ability scores. If the player level is lower than the current enemy level, it will decrease some ability scores.

Max scores for an ability is 30, if it reaches 30, it won\textquotesingle{}t do anything

Calculate the difference between old and new constitution scores to figure out how many points must be added or removed from the hit points

Adjust the current and total hit points to the player\textquotesingle{}s level

Set all the attributes of the character
