\subsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \hyperlink{class_item_container}{Item\+Container} class. 

1) Game rules\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_item}{Item} container can be either a \textquotesingle{}B\+A\+C\+K\+P\+A\+CK\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}E\+Q\+U\+I\+P\+P\+ED\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}T\+R\+E\+A\+S\+U\+RE C\+H\+E\+ST\textquotesingle{}.
\item A container can contain any number of items.
\item A player should be able to obtain items from a container, as well as getting information about them, such as the type.
\item Items should be transferable between containers (e.\+g. from treasure chest into backpack, from backpack into equipped), therefore they should be removable.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2) Design\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The container class has three different constructors, making it easier to create a container in different ways. For example, if there is an existing list of items, it can be passed as parameter to a constructor and used to initialize the vector of items of the container. It is also possible to create an empty container, which has its own empty vector of items. Items can then be added into the container one by one.
\end{DoxyItemize}

3) Libraries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A S\+TL container (vector) was used to contain all the item objects. This allows easier manipulation of the items, such as adding and removing as many items as we want.
\item String was included to use string data types
\item In the .cpp file, iostream was included to output strings to the stream. Enhancements and their bonus can be easily displayed to the stream. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
