\subsection{Detailed Description}
Header file for the \hyperlink{class_item}{Item} class. 

1) Game rules\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An item can only be of type \textquotesingle{}H\+E\+L\+M\+ET\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}A\+R\+M\+OR\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}S\+H\+I\+E\+LD\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}R\+I\+NG\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}B\+E\+LT\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}B\+O\+O\+TS\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}W\+E\+A\+P\+ON\textquotesingle{}.
\item An item can enhance only a certain combination of character statistics as described in the instruction.
\item The player should be able to view information about each item, such as the type and the enhancements with their respective values.
\item The enhancements should be obtainable in order to apply it onto the character\textquotesingle{}s statistics.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2) Design\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \hyperlink{class_item}{Item} class is a superclass of \hyperlink{class_helmet}{Helmet}, \hyperlink{class_armor}{Armor}, \hyperlink{class_shield}{Shield}, \hyperlink{class_ring}{Ring}, \hyperlink{class_belt}{Belt}, \hyperlink{class_boots}{Boots} and \hyperlink{class_weapon}{Weapon} classes.
\item Since different types of items only provide a certain combinations of valid enhancement types, it would be more efficient to implement each subclass with different constructors that allow easier initialization of the enhancement types. Validating an item can also be done easily by checking the list of stats that the item enhances against the valid enhancements that each item type can have.
\end{DoxyItemize}

3) Libraries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A S\+TL container (vector) was used to contain all the enhancement objects. This allows easier manipulation of the enhancements, such as adding an enhancement to the vector.
\item String was included to use string data types
\item In the .cpp file, iostream was included to output strings to the stream. Enhancements and their bonus can be easily displayed to the stream. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
