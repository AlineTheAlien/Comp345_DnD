Header file for the map class The following class implements a map according to the rules of Dungeons and Dragons The map consists of a grid. In each tile of the map, there could be an enemy, a chest, a wall, a door or the player. The player will be able to move everywhere except on wall tiles which are considered as occupied tiles that the player can\textquotesingle{}t walk on. After creation of the map, the validate\+Path() method will be called to validate the map. A path must exist between the player and the door for the map to be valid. For now, the rules allow only one door and one player on the map. The door is considered in the game as the exit point. No external libraries were used. The map is presented in the console for simplicity as a matrix.
